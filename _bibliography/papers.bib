The first subtaskof EDiReF shared task aims to assign an emo-tions to a Hindi-English code mixed conversa-tion. For this, our team proposes a system toidentify the emotion based on fine-tuning largelanguage models on the MaSaC dataset. Forour study we have fine tuned 2 LLMs BERTand Llama 2 to perform sequence classificationto identify the emotion of the text.",
