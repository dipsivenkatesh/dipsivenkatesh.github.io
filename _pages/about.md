Hi! I'm Dilip Venkatesh, a Master's student at NYU Courant advised by [Dr. Yann LeCun](https://yann.lecun.com/) working on latent space reasoning.

My research interests lie in 
 - technical AI alignment of large language models
 - mechanistical interpretability
 - reasoning (more recently in the latent space!)

I was previously a researcher at [AI4Bharat](https://ai4bharat.iitm.ac.in/), IIT Madras, where I was  advised by [Dr. Anoop Kunchukuttan](https://anoopk.in/) and [Dr. Raj Dabre](https://prajdabre.github.io/) on multilingual NLP.

I'm on the lookout for PhD positions for Fall 2026!
